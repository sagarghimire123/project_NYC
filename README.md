# project_NYC(1st project as a data science student with very basic codings learned during class.)

This was a data science project related to the exploration and analysis of NYC HIV/AIDS cases for the years 2010 to 2013. This was my first project while starting my major as data science student. The project includes basic coding learned during early days of class.The data set was taken from NYC open data. This project analyzed the HIV/AIDS cases of NYC throughout the neighborhood present in New York City. The language used in this project was Python and various libraries like Pandas and NumPy were used to do the analysis. The purpose of this project was to answer the questions raised during the project proposal. All the questions related to this project are in the notebook.
